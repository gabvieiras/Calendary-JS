# Interactive Calendar

This project is a simple interactive calendar for June 2022, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calendar displays the days of the month in a tabular format and allows users to select days to display the formatted date in text form.

Features
Calendar Display: The calendar shows the month of June 2022 with all the days organized in a table. Days that do not belong to June are shown in a lighter shade to indicate they are from the previous or next month.
Day Selection: Clicking a day button will display the date in a textual format below the calendar. The date is formatted in Portuguese, showing the day name, month, and year.
Style and Design: The calendar has a user-friendly interface with rounded borders on cell corners and different colors for weekdays and days off.

Structure
HTML: Defines the basic structure of the calendar, including the table with days of the month and the place to display the selected date.
CSS: Styles the calendar, including day positioning, background colors, rounded borders, and button styles.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the calendar. When a day is clicked, JavaScript formats and displays the corresponding date in textual format.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the page.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For interactive functionality and data manipulation.

Examples
Formatted Date: Clicking on day 1 will display: "First of June 2022".
